#### Kyblu camera is a pixel camera that is used from Farcaster, you can make pixel art photos to mint them directly in Zora from the app.

### Where the sponsor's tech?

In [src/mint.ts](https://github.com/martinsegura/Kyblu-camera/blob/main/src/mint.ts) is the whole implementation of the **Zora SDK**
I only needed to use *CreateCoin()* since the app only facilitates minting.

In [src/config.ts](https://github.com/martinsegura/Kyblu-camera/blob/main/src/config.ts) the whole implementation of the connection with the wallet to work with **Farcaster**.

[src/index.js](https://github.com/martinsegura/Kyblu-camera/blob/main/src/index.js) contains the camera functions and the call to **create the coins** and *sdk.actions.ready()* from **Farcaster**.
