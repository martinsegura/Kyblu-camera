### Inspiration

Kyblu Camera is inspired by the [Game Boy Camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Hnggc_FbSA) and Instagram filters. During the last time Zora has positioned itself as the favorite onchain social and it makes a lot of sense to think about facilitating creative filters to expand the ways of content creation on the dapp, on the other hand Farcaster has also had a great growth and the possibility of using Mini Apps with the integrated wallet facilitates a lot the decentralized use of content creation, making it very easy to create a mint on Zora from your smartphone through an application that allows you to give a unique and artistic touch to your moment.

### Where the sponsor's tech?

In [src/mint.ts](https://github.com/martinsegura/Kyblu-camera/blob/main/src/mint.ts) is the whole implementation of the **Zora SDK**
I only needed to use *CreateCoin()* since the app only facilitates minting.

In [src/config.ts](https://github.com/martinsegura/Kyblu-camera/blob/main/src/config.ts) the whole implementation of the connection with the wallet to work with **Farcaster**.

[src/index.js](https://github.com/martinsegura/Kyblu-camera/blob/main/src/index.js) contains the camera functions and the call to **create the coins** and *sdk.actions.ready()* from **Farcaster**.
